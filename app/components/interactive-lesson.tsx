          <h2>What is Debate?</h2>
          <p>Debate is a structured argument where two sides present opposing viewpoints on a specific topic. It's not just about winning - it's about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Critical thinking:</strong> Analyzing issues from multiple perspectives</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Expressing ideas clearly and persuasively</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Finding and evaluating evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Listening:</strong> Understanding and responding to opposing arguments</li>
          </ul>

        sampleAnswer:
          "Mandatory voting should be implemented because it strengthens democracy, reduces political inequality, and increases government legitimacy. Point: Mandatory voting ensures true democratic representation. Evidence: Australia, which has compulsory voting, consistently achieves 95%+ turnout compared to 55% in voluntary systems like the US. Explanation: High turnout means elected officials represent the will of the entire population, not just politically engaged minorities. Link: This creates governments that truly reflect society's diverse needs and priorities. Point: Mandatory voting reduces the influence of extreme political groups. Evidence: Political scientist Dr. Sarah Chen's research shows that voluntary voting systems amplify the voices of the most politically passionate, often the most extreme 10% on each side. Explanation: When everyone votes, moderate voices balance out extremes, leading to more centrist, practical policies. Link: This moderation is essential for stable, effective governance. However, critics argue that forced voting violates personal freedom. While individual liberty is important, this overlooks that voting is a civic duty like jury service or paying taxes. In fact, mandatory voting enhances freedom by ensuring everyone's voice is heard equally, preventing wealthy or extreme groups from dominating elections. This is significant because true freedom requires equal political participation, not just the option to participate. Therefore, mandatory voting strengthens democracy by ensuring representative outcomes, moderating extreme politics, and protecting equal civic participation for all citizens.",

        sampleAnswer:
          "AI should be banned from making employment decisions because it perpetuates discrimination, lacks human judgment, and threatens worker dignity. Point: AI systems amplify existing workplace discrimination. Evidence: Amazon scrapped its AI recruiting tool in 2018 after discovering it systematically downgraded resumes from women, and a 2023 MIT study found that 76% of AI hiring systems show racial bias. Explanation: These systems learn from historical hiring data that reflects past discrimination, meaning they perpetuate and amplify human prejudices rather than eliminating them. Link: Banning AI from employment decisions would prevent the institutionalization of discrimination in hiring processes. Point: Employment decisions require human judgment that AI cannot replicate. Evidence: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, a workplace psychology expert, argues that successful hiring depends on assessing cultural fit, emotional intelligence, and potential for growth - qualities that require human intuition. Explanation: AI can process data but cannot evaluate the subtle interpersonal skills, creativity, and adaptability that make employees successful in dynamic work environments. Link: Human oversight in employment decisions ensures that hiring considers the full spectrum of human potential. Critics argue that AI eliminates human bias and increases efficiency. While efficiency is valuable, this overlooks that AI doesn't eliminate bias - it systematizes it. In fact, human recruiters can be trained to recognize and counteract their biases, while AI systems operate as black boxes that hide their discriminatory processes. This is significant because employment decisions fundamentally affect people's livelihoods and dignity, requiring the empathy and accountability that only humans can provide. Therefore, AI should be banned from employment decisions to protect against discrimination, preserve human judgment in hiring, and maintain the dignity of work in our society.",

          "This statement contains an ad hominem fallacy. Instead of addressing the substance of teenagers' climate change arguments, it attacks their credibility based on age. This is problematic because it dismisses potentially valid points without engaging with the actual evidence or reasoning presented. Age doesn't automatically invalidate someone's ability to understand scientific data or moral arguments about environmental protection. A stronger approach would be to evaluate the specific claims and evidence rather than dismissing them based on the speaker's demographics.",
